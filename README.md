Tekact - my teksavvy playground.

Development Setup:

1. Created a cordova app
    `cordova create tekact`
2. Initialize npm's package.json
    `npm init`
3. Added Framework7 by using bower to pull the source, first install bower if
you don't already have it.  
    `npm install bower -g`
4. Now install/fetch Framework7 by running
    `bower install framework7`
5. Take the dist folder and place under the www/libs folder.  We're interested
in the dist folder so copy the dist folder under www/libs/framework7/ just to help
organize our dependencies.
